Project Objective: Presents a gallery of cards from the Digimon Card game. These cards can be filtered by stats, color, and keywords. Users can also comment on these cards.

Statement of Work: Use an API to pull up cards for display. Make a form to allow users to filter out the gallery. If user clicks on a card, have the site pull up a new page dedicated to that card. Make a secondary object that can hold the comments unique to each card.

Feature 1: Analyze text of comment box and display character count for limit.

Just to force users to get their point across with thoughts on the particular card. I do not believe a user needs a 1000 characters to do that.

Feature 2: Retrieve data from the API to display the card's image and allow the data to be used to filter the gallery.

The main purpose of the site.

Feature 3: Persist data to an external API and make the stored data accessible in your app.

Allow for future users to read up on the comments of the cards or even respond to them.

Feature 4: Using the React framework to develope my site.

Ideally to help streamline the process.

Wishful ideas: I would really love to make a "deck object", which would contain an array of the cards from the api to allow users to make their own decks, and even do some practice hands with them.

How to run the site:

First, open terminal and cd to the where main.jsx is. Next, use the command "npm run dev" to start the site.
